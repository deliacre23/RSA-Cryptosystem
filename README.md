This is a project that implements an RSA cryptosystem with the following features:

 - A graphical interface. The alphabet has 27 characters: the blank and the 26 letters of the English alphabet.
 - Generates a public key and a private key. The public key is randomly generated in the required interval.
 - Using the public key, encrypts a given plaintext. There is a plaintext validation.
 - Using the private key, decrypts a given ciphertext. There is a ciphertext validation
